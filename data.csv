Emotions on Canvas: An Art Therapy Workshop ,"About the WorkshopHow often do we come across situations where expressing yourself seems difficult if not entirely impossible? More often or not we get trapped in our own minds and find it difficult to understand our emotions, our triggers, our reactions etc. When expressing in words becomes difficult, using art as a means of self-expression comes handy. It offers a mode of self-discovery to foster happiness and emotional resilience.&amp;nbsp;“Emotions on Canvas” will provide you with a creative outlet to cope with the stress and anxiety of everyday life. It will tap into your subconscious mind to release the inner stress, process emotions better and find clarity and meaning in everyday life. Through fun and interactive art activities, you will explore self-expression and, in doing so, find new ways to gain personal insight and increase your happiness level. The best part about “Emotions of Canvas” is that it is specially curated for every individual irrespective of their expertise in art. We believe that every art is beautiful in its own way and tells a story so personal and so inspiring.&amp;nbsp;The Workshop Environment&amp;nbsp;This will be an interactive workshop with different art-based activities.You will work in a creative and encouraging environment to destress and rediscover yourself&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Participants from all professional backgrounds and age groups are welcomeNo previous experience requiredP.s. the workshop is most fun when you gran yourself a quiet corner and attend it with full concentrationMaterials Needed5 blank sheets of papera set of any kind of colours you likeAbout the FacilitatorMs Aradhna, a Therapeutic Art Life Coach, believes that her role is to help people explore and express themselves authentically through art. She believes that through this process, people may find relief from overwhelming emotions, crises or trauma. They may discover insights about themselves, increase their sense of well-being, enrich their daily lives through creative expression, or experience personal transformation. She uses the power of art to expand self-understanding, to offer insight not available through other means, and to extend people’s ability to communicate. She believes that finding personal meaning in one’s images is often part of the art therapy process and that for some people, it is one of the most potent therapeutic qualities of art expression. It is a powerful way of knowing yourself better and leading a happier life.About the Host&amp;nbsp;TlkOut is a peer-to-peer support platform available globally on the android and iOS platforms.&amp;nbsp;We connect those who are presently struggling and those who have struggled in past in a safe, judgment-free environment thus encouraging them to ‘TlkOut’ and feel accepted.

Raghav&apos;s musical endeavors began post a successful stint at &apos;The Stage&apos;, where he ended up as a semi-finalist (Top 6). Following a crowdfunding campaign that resulted in his debut album, &apos;Songs From A Matchbox&apos;, he has been taking his brand of &apos;vocal first&apos; music around the country, with a string of performances at some of the most coveted platforms for live music, such as the Bacardi NH7 Weekender, Ranthambore Music Festival, Ctrl Alt Del and more. He also lent his voice to Abhay Deol for critically acclaimed director Meghna Ramaswamy&apos;s &apos;What Are The Odds?&apos;, which premiered at the prestigious Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles.

Over the course of the past couple of months, Raghav has fostered an online community of singer-songwriters, where budding artists can share their work with like-minded individuals. The ‘Cone-munity’, as it has come to be known, is a safe space for artists to showcase their work in front of an enthusiastic and receptive audience, whilst broadening their horizons and growing together.",2021-03-06T11:30:00.000Z,2021-03-06T13:30:00.000Z,https://insider.in/how-to-write-your-first-song-by-raghav-meattle-kommune-mar6-2021/event,music
